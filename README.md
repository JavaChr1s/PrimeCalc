# PrimeCalc

This little project was created to support my girlfriend who wants to make a distributed quiz application where different questions are asked and a certain set of answers are displayed to choose from. We talked about methods to store the the answers to the questions. She wants to use a prime for each possible answer, so that the set of all correct answers can be stored as the product of the correct answers' primes. 
So I decided to write a little program, where primes are generated and products are generated so that my girlfriend gets a picture of the sizes of the results and things like that.
